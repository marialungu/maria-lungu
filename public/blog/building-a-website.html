                    <p class="ml-p">
                        Building a website from scratch can be a demanding project. Building a good and functional website can be a challenging and overwhelming one. There are many aspects to keep in mind. In this article I’ll help you figure out all the details about concept and design, from the structure of your website to the graphical elements that you’ll need. To do this, we’ll take my current website as a case study. ...
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h4 class="ml-h4 lato-spacing">Defining the purpose of your website</h4>
                    <p class="ml-p">
                        The first thing that you need to ask yourself when beginning to build a website is its purpose. Is it a presentation website? A blog? An online shop? Maybe a platform? It is important to define this purpose before anything else, as it will determine every design decision that you’ll make afterwards.                            
                    </p>
                    <p class="ml-p">
                        Another important question to ask is ‘why?’. Why do you need to build this website? What informations do you need to provide? If it’s a presentation website, what are you presenting and what informations do you need to put out? If it’s an online shop it means that you are trying to sell some products. This implies a different layout and completely different design choices.
                    </p>
                    <p class="ml-p">
                        Let’s take my website, for example. This is a presentation website, as it basically shows details about me, my experience, my contact details, my work etc. I built this personal website to show my work and to find possible clients that would need my skills and expertise for their projects. Therefore, I’ll need to design it in a way to show all this information in an interesting and relevant way, so a person that comes upon it will get all the details he needs to start working with me.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h4 class="ml-h4 lato-spacing">Finding some inspiration</h4>
                    <p class="ml-p">
                        Figuring out a way to organise a lot of information in a good and simple way can be complicated. Finding the perfect design specifically for your work can be overwhelming given how many options are out there. You need to make the best one for your project so a good start is to find some inspiration. Go ahead and search online for the best designs made for a website similar to yours. Figure out what is outstanding on these websites, what works perfectly and what doesn’t. Figure out what would work for you and have a brainstorm.                            
                    </p>
                    <p class="ml-p">
                        In my case, I searched for the best web designs for a Front-End Developer Portfolio website. The results were amazing so I made a list of the ones that impressed me the most and I figured out what I liked most about them. I didn’t stop at “Front-End Developer Portfolio website”, though. I looked around for presentation websites and I looked for interesting design features, small details, colors etc. For example, on one website I loved the design and functionality of the side menu. On another site I liked the loaders. Afterwards, I had a little brainstorm and I came up with some basic ideas for my loaders, menus, and layouts.                            
                    </p>
                    <p class="ml-p">
                        Some websites where you can find a lot of interesting ideas and inspiration and that I strongly recommend are <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/">Smashing Magazine</a>, <a href="https://pinterest.com/">Pinterest</a>, <a href="https://www.behance.net/">Behance</a> and <a href="https://www.awwwards.com/">Awwwards</a>.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h4 class="ml-h4 lato-spacing">Deciding on a theme</h4>
                    <p class="ml-p">
                        Now that you found out the purpose of your website and you have an idea about your main content and the design direction you need to take, it’s time to decide on the theme of your website. This will help you figure out the fonts that you’ll need to use, the graphical elements, the logo, colors etc. To make the decision easier, write down the main concepts that define your website. The theme should reflect the website’s purpose.
                    </p>
                    <p class="ml-p">
                        For example, on my website the main concepts that could define it were ‘technology’, ‘creativity’, ‘art’, ‘simplicity’, so I decided on a minimalist, geometric theme. As this is my personal website and I’m a Front-End Developer I needed something to show my love for technology in an artistic way, therefore I went for a simple, minimalist, geometric pattern. Keeping in mind this idea, I was also inspired by the ‘wire-frame’ idea, hence the connected geometric polygons used as a recurrent graphical element.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h4 class="ml-h4 lato-spacing">Defining brand identity</h4>
                    <p class="ml-p">
                        Another important aspect is to define your brand and your visual identity. When doing this, keep in mind the theme that you chose previously. To tackle this, start by listing every element that you need and the logo and sketch them out to figure out how you’d like them to look in their final form. These could be progress bars, boxes, icons, background etc. Also, make sure you are consistent in you design choices.
                    </p>
                    <p class="ml-p">
                        As I wanted to keep my website on the minimalist side, for my graphical elements I just needed the geometric, wire-frame-like background, progress bars and icons. Keeping in mind the consistency issue, I built the progress bars as wire frames. Now when it came to my logo, I decided to go for a minimalist lettering of my initials, ‘ML’. I sketched out a few designs before settling on the current one.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h4 class="ml-h4 lato-spacing">Defining the website’s structure and sketching the mockups</h4>
                    <p class="ml-p">
                        So far, you made made all the groundwork, from defining the website’s purpose to defining your brand. Now it is time to decide how your website should look like in terms of structure and layout. To do this, decide what are the pages of your website and what is their content. Write down this structure and then start sketching those layouts. You can go an extra step and actually create the mockups as there are powerful apps and tools to help you do this.                            
                    </p>
                    <p class="ml-p">
                        Another important thing to keep in mind when sketching the mockups and designing the structure is User Experience (UX). The main questions to ask yourself can be ‘How many steps does a user need to take in order to get the information that he needs from your website?’, ‘How can you simplify this process?’. One principle that can help you in this step is KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid).
                    </p>
                    <p class="ml-p">
                        For example, when building this website I decided that my pages were the Home Page, with a brief description of the purpose of this website and a Contact me button, so a visitor can easily send me a message, without too much searching. Next, I have an About Me Page, with a more detailed description of who I am, what I can do and what work experience I have. Afterwards, there’s a Skills Page where I listed all my abilities. After a while I added the Blog Page, where I can share a few articles about my work, technologies I’ve been using and so on. Last but not least, I have a Contact Page, where I share my contact information. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="ml-p">
                        After deciding on this structure, I quickly sketched up some layouts for these pages and I figured out how I wanted to present all these informations. For example, on the Skills Page, I wanted a more visual representation of my abilities, so I used progress bars. I didn’t actually create the mockups, as they were really simple layouts and I already knew what I wanted, but on more complicated designs I strongly recommend making them first.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h4 class="ml-h4 lato-spacing">Deciding on the color scheme and fonts</h4>
                    <p class="ml-p">
                        Now we almost reached our final step. One of the last things you need to do when building a website is to create a color scheme and to pick up the fonts. To do so, you have to keep in mind the theme and purpose of your website, as they can easily guide you to the most appropriate color scheme and font choices. For example, a website dedicated to moms will have a completely different color scheme and fonts than a website made for car lovers.
                    </p>
                    <p class="ml-p">
                        Colors and fonts play a really important role in transmitting your message, but I am not going to dive into much detail in this article, as Color Theory and Typography are really vast subjects. Although, there are a few simple rules to begin with. When it comes to colors, keep in mind that you need two dark color for text and accents; two light colors for background and accents; a bold color that is going to be the core color of your website; a neutral color and a contrast color. Those rules are not written in stone, they are just a guide. When making a color scheme you have to think about the use of those colors throughout your website and branding materials.
                    </p>
                    <p class="ml-p">
                        When it comes to fonts, it is recommended to use a maximum of three fonts. Keep in mind that you have to choose them in order to create a visual hierarchy and contrast. Do not combine fonts that are too similar, as they will create no contrast. You can pair a sans-serif font with a serif font or you can use the same font, but with different weights and sizes.
                    </p>
                    <p class="ml-p">
                        Again, let’s take my website, for example. I used a copper-navy color scheme. I figured this will be fitted as I am a Frontend developer and designer, so I needed something to show my artistic side and my technical profile. My theme was also minimalist and geometrical, so these colors are simple and bring a balanced contrast.
                    </p>
                    <p class="ml-p">
                        When it came to fonts, I used <a href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google Fonts</a> to come up with a scheme. I chose a bold font for titles, a font for large bodies of text and a font for accents. I chose all of them sans-serif, as this is a technical website. 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h4 class="ml-h4 lato-spacing">Design!</h4>
                    <p class="ml-p">
                        With every detail figured out, all we got left to do is … actually design it! In this final step you will create all the graphical elements needed, this including the logo and branding. You can use some online tools to help you or the Adobe Creative Suite. You can also find online tutorials to help you with illustrating and designing the logo, icons etc.                            
                    </p>
                    <p class="ml-p">
                        In my case, I needed the menu icon, logo, background and progress bars and I created them using Adobe Illustrator CC. 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="ml-p">
                        To conclude, this article was a brief overview of the process of building a website's concept and design. I will come back with a more in-depth view on each matter. In the meantime I hope you found it helpful and that you now have a more clear view on web design.
